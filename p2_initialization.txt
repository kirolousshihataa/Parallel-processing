Regarding Initialization

Consider a 5x5 grid with init temps:
    100 on the top row
    200 on the left col
    300 on the right col
    400 on the bottom

The assignment says to initialize the edges in this manner:

    To make sure that the corners are initialized in the same manner, we will
    initialize the rows and columns in this order:
        entire top row (0)
        entire left column (0)
        entire right column (N-1)
        entire bottom row (M-1)

If we did just that much, we would have edges like this:

200 100 100 100 300
200             300
200             300
200             300
400 400 400 400 400

The top row originally would have had all 100's.
But the top-left value would become 200 when we then initialized the ENTIRE left col.
The top-right value would have become 300 when we initialize the ENTIRE right col.
The entire bottom row would be come all 400's when we initialize the ENTIRE bottom row.

There are 16 values around those edges which, when summed, total 4300.

4300/16 = 268.75  which would become the initial value for all the interior points,
based on this comment in the project description:

    A common way to initialize the interior points of the grid is to set them
    all to the average of all the values along the edges.
